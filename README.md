This is a custom trigonometry library I created to learn about the Taylor Series and become more familiar with functions.
The functions that start with "r" (rsin, rcos, etc.) are meant to be used with radians. Likewise, the functions that start with "d" (dsin, dcos, etc.) are meant to be used with degrees.
